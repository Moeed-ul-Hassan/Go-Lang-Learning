## Overall Strategy

* **Consistency:** Adhere to the 5-hour daily schedule.
* **Hands-on Learning:** Prioritize practical coding and building.
* **Small Projects:** Implement small applications or tools for each new concept.
* **Regular Review:** Dedicate time weekly to consolidate learned material.

## Daily Schedule Breakdown

* **3:00 PM - 4:30 PM (1.5 hours):** Learn New Concepts & Theory (Documentation, tutorials, syntax).
* **4:30 PM - 5:00 PM (0.5 hours):** Short Break & Quick Review of previous day's concepts.
* **5:00 PM - 7:00 PM (2 hours):** Hands-on Coding (Exercises, examples, start small projects).

### Week 4: I/O, Files, and Standard Library (Jan 26 - Feb 1)

* **Topics:** `os` package (file operations, environment variables), Reading/writing files (`bufio`, `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`), JSON encoding/decoding (`encoding/json`), HTTP package (basic web servers, making requests), Context package.
* **Practice:** Program to read/process/write files (CSV/JSON), simple "Hello World" web server.
