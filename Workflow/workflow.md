# Go Lang Learning Workflow

**Goal:** Learn Go Lang and secure a well-paying job in Slovenia by early 2027, starting with a freelancing journey after Ramadan 2026 (February 17, 2026).

**Daily Study Time:** 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM (5 hours)

---

## Overall Strategy:

*   **Consistency:** Adhere to the 5-hour daily schedule.
*   **Hands-on Learning:** Prioritize practical coding and building.
*   **Small Projects:** Implement small applications or tools for each new concept.
*   **Regular Review:** Dedicate time weekly to consolidate learned material.

## Daily Schedule Breakdown:

*   **3:00 PM - 4:30 PM (1.5 hours):** Learn New Concepts & Theory (Documentation, tutorials, syntax).
*   **4:30 PM - 5:00 PM (0.5 hours):** Short Break & Quick Review of previous day's concepts.
*   **5:00 PM - 7:00 PM (2 hours):** Hands-on Coding (Exercises, examples, start small projects).
*   **7:00 PM - 8:00 PM (1 hour):** Project Work / Problem Solving / Deeper Dive into challenging topics.

## Learning Plan (Approx. 6 Weeks - Until Feb 16, 2026):

### Week 1: Go Fundamentals (Jan 5 - Jan 11)
*   **Topics:** Go installation, VS Code setup, `go mod`, Basic syntax, variables, data types (integers, floats, booleans, strings), Constants, `iota`, Control flow (`if/else`, `switch`), Loops (`for`), Functions (declaration, parameters, return values, multiple return values), **Arrays** and Slices, Variadic functions.
*   **Practice:** Simple calculators, conditional logic, array/slice manipulations.

### Week 2: Data Structures & Pointers (Jan 12 - Jan 18)
*   **Topics:** Maps, Structs, Pointers, Methods, Interfaces, Type assertions and type switches.
*   **Practice:** Simple contact book using structs and maps, implementing methods.

### Week 3: Concurrency & Error Handling (Jan 19 - Jan 25)
*   **Topics:** Goroutines, Channels, `select`, Mutexes and `sync` package, Error handling (`error` interface, custom errors, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`), `defer`, `panic`, `recover`.
*   **Practice:** Concurrent program (e.g., web scraper), robust error handling.

### Week 4: I/O, Files, and Standard Library (Jan 26 - Feb 1)
*   **Topics:** `os` package (file operations, environment variables), Reading/writing files (`bufio`, `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`), JSON encoding/decoding (`encoding/json`), HTTP package (basic web servers, making requests), Context package.
*   **Practice:** Program to read/process/write files (CSV/JSON), simple "Hello World" web server.

### Week 5: Advanced Topics & Project Work (Feb 2 - Feb 8)
*   **Topics:** Testing (unit tests, table-driven tests), Dependency management (`go mod`), Introduction to database interaction (`database/sql`, e.g., SQLite), Building a small REST API.
*   **Practice:** Write tests, integrate a database into a web server.

### Week 6: Review & Project Refinement (Feb 9 - Feb 16)
*   **Topics:** Review all core concepts, Refactor and improve existing projects, Work on a slightly larger project combining multiple concepts (e.g., simple blog API, CLI tool), Focus on code quality and best practices.
*   **Goal:** Have at least one solid project to showcase.
