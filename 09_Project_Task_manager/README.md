# Project: Task Manager (Basic)

This is the first project in the Go course, designed to practice basic syntax, slices, and user input.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Store task descriptions in a slice.
- **List Tasks**: Display all tasks with their index.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks using slice manipulation.

## Concepts Practiced
1. **Slices**: Using `append` to add tasks and slicing to remove them.
2. **Loops**: Using `for` loops to display the menu and list tasks.
3. **User Input**: Using `fmt.Scanln` or `bufio` to get input from the console.
4. **Control Flow**: Using `switch` statements for the main menu logic.

## Key Learnings
- How to manage a dynamic list of items.
- Handling the "off-by-one" error when users enter 1-based indices for 0-based slices.
- Basic CLI application structure.
