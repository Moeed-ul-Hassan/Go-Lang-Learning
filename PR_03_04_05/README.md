# Practice: Concepts 03, 04, and 05

This folder contains practice exercises combining Comma Ok syntax, Type Conversions, and the Time package.

## Practice Scenarios
1. **User Input Conversion**: Read a string from the user, convert it to an integer, and handle potential errors.
2. **Map & Time**: Store the "Last Login" time for users in a map and check existence using the comma-ok idiom.
3. **Age Calculator**: Take a birth year as a string, convert it to an int, and calculate age using `time.Now().Year()`.

## Why Practice These Together?
These three concepts are the "glue" of many Go programs. You'll constantly be:
- Getting data (often as strings).
- Converting it to the right type.
- Storing it in maps.
- Checking if it exists.
- Timestamping actions.

Mastering these basics makes moving on to complex topics like Concurrency and Web Servers much easier.
