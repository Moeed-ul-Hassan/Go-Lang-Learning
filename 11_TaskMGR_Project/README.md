# Project: Task Manager (Advanced)

An evolution of the basic Task Manager, incorporating more complex data structures and better code organization.

## Features
- **Task Structs**: Tasks are now objects with `ID`, `Title`, and `IsCompleted` status.
- **Persistence (Optional)**: Concepts for saving/loading data.
- **Better UX**: Improved menu navigation and error messages.

## Concepts Practiced
1. **Structs**: Modeling data more realistically.
2. **Maps vs Slices**: Deciding which structure is better for task lookup.
3. **Functions**: Breaking down the logic into reusable parts (modularization).
4. **Error Handling**: Validating user input and handling edge cases.

## Key Learnings
- The importance of data modeling before writing logic.
- How to update specific fields in a struct within a collection.
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code by separating concerns.
